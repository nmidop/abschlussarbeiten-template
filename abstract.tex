\addchaptertocentry{Abstract} % Add the abstract to the table of contents

If you are writing your thesis in English, you also need to provide an English Abstract.
Content-wise it should be the same as the German. 
Also, it should not be longer than one page.

If you happen to write in German, you can safely omit the English Abstract.
